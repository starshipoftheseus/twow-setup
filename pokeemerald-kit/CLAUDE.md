# CLAUDE.md — pokeemerald-expansion hack

This is a ROM hack built on rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion (a C decompilation of Pokémon Emerald for GBA).

## Read first
- `design/` holds the plan for this hack. Check it before inventing story, names, teams or balance numbers. If it doesn't cover something, ask.
- `docs/` holds the upstream tutorials. Prefer them over guesses about how a system works.

## Build & verify
- Build: `make -j$(nproc)` → `pokeemerald.gba`. Run it after every change and fix all errors and new warnings before reporting done.
- Tests: `make check -j$(nproc)` runs the battle/engine test suite. Run it after any battle, move, ability or item change.
- Never say a change works unless it built. You can't playtest; tell me exactly what to check in the emulator.

## Where things live
- Config toggles: `include/config/*.h` (battle gen mechanics, features). Prefer flipping a config over editing engine code.
- Species data: `src/data/pokemon/species_info/`; learnsets: `src/data/pokemon/`
- Trainers: `src/data/trainers.party` (text format)
- Moves / abilities / items: `src/data/moves_info.h`, `src/data/abilities.h`, `src/data/items.h`
- Wild encounters: `src/data/wild_encounters.json`
- Maps & scripts: `data/maps/<Map>/` (`map.json`, `scripts.inc` or `scripts.pory`)
- Flags / vars: `include/constants/flags.h`, `include/constants/vars.h`

## Rules
- Maps, map layouts, warps and object placement are edited in **Porymap**, not by hand-editing `map.json`/layouts. You may edit a map's scripts.
- New flags/vars: reuse an unused slot (`FLAG_UNUSED_*` / `VAR_UNUSED_*`) and `#define` a descriptive name for it. Never repurpose a flag the game still uses.
- New scripts: write Poryscript (`.pory`) if this repo uses it; otherwise follow existing `.inc` style.
- Keep engine changes minimal and isolated so upstream expansion updates still merge. Don't reformat or rename upstream code.
- Don't touch `tools/`, the Makefile or generated files unless asked.
- One task at a time; small diffs. Summarise what you changed and which files.

## Git
- I commit before each task. Don't commit or push unless I ask.
